An experiment to work with .NET Core, C#, React, Tailwind and DaisyUI.

I learned how to use .NET Core as a backend API while keeping it modern with React and CSS frameworks.


## What does it do?

You can search for any Pokemon and get information about it, such as image, height, weight and moves of the pokemon.

## Try it

If you want to try this you should:

- Clone the repo
- Install .NET SDK
- Go to "clientapp" folder in terminal and run "yarn install" or "npm install"
- Go to the root folder and run "dotnet run" (might require you to run "ln -s /usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet /usr/local/bin/" first on Mac)
- Simultaneously go to the "clientapp" folder and run "yarn start" or "npm run start"
- Open the project in whatever localhost link the terminal gives you for the the React project
- Enjoy the Pokemon stats!

Thank you!
